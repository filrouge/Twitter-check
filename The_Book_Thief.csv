ONCE A THIEF wasn't the first time Delon was in a film based on a Zekial Marko book. Two years earlier Delon starred with Jean Gabin in ANY NUMBER CAN WIN (1963) which was an adaptation of Marko's heist novel THE BIG GRAB written under his pen name John Trinian. https://t.co/T9aPL6G1Xw,2,2021-07-08 17:30:11
Playing today on TCM is ONCE A THIEF (1965). Alain Delon plays an ex-con trying to make a better life but things don't go as planned. I like this film and the book it was based on (which has a different ending) SCRATCH A THIEF by Zekial Marko who also wrote the screenplay. https://t.co/39USe2dq58,2,2021-07-08 17:30:09
